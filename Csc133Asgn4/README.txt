To Run the Program:

change directory to (whatever)/bin
Then type a4.Starter.

Special Notes:
For some reason, one of the fuel cans when hit won't move.  Should still be selectable, "grabbable", though.


NPC's have a thing where:
	They have a "Null" strategy, where if they are given a null strategy, they go to the top left of the panel
	They have drawn lines, where the lines are where the NPC is going to, not necessarily going to that line.
	They also can "flank" the car, driving by the sides a bit, but always converge on one point.
	They all start at one location, as it looks cool (and dr. c. said it was ok).
	Addendum:
	I put the files in the "sounds" folder so I can organize it better.  I hope it still works.
	NPC's have rotors to fly:  they're helicopters.  Sadly, the rotors still move if paused AND clicking something.
	Old controls and new controls work(Press "A" or "UP" to accelerate, etc.
